# Big-Ints-Cpp
Use unsigned integers providing 128, 256, 512, ..., 16384 bits of memory, written in standard C++

This library provides seven different types (classes).
Basic arithmetic functions are implemented (+; -; *; /).
Additional functions included are a power function, logarithm and roots.
Constructors take bitsets, strings representing binary sequences, ints, and lower Big Ints.
Makros define smallest and biggest possible value.

...Might be extended in future...
